      <h3>Our History</h3>

        <p>Our first festival was started as a small showcase of the area's agriculture in 1982. While it was designed to be more akin to a farmer's market, it slowly added more vendors and entertainment. The festival grew larger and became a firm part of the community. Now, it has evolved to become a regional spectacle that brings people from all over.</p>
